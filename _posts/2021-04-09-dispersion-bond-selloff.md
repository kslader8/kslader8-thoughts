title: Dispersion as a Hedge Against Bond Selloff?
---

## Conjecture
When bonds selloff, investors should expect a wave of equity dispersion and subdued index volatility.


## What is a dispersion trade?
Dispersion is a relative value trade comprised of
- A short position on the underlying index's implied volatility. The lower the realized volatility the better
- A long position on the index components (that are likely to have volatility spike). The higher the average realized voatility the better.


## Why trade dispersion?
Strong demand by outright investors for index performance protection from puts because of
- A relatively high implied volatiltiy on the index in relation to its components
- A steeper skew on an index's implied volatitly that that of single stocks

Strong demand for yield enhancement products resulting in depressed volatility from
- The impacts of hedging these products
- The call overwritting flows on these products pushing short term vol lower on single stocks

**Dispersion trades caputre both of these dislocations!**


## Why consider dispersion when bonds selloff? 
- **Significant sector rotation**, usually leads to larger winners and losers, opening opportunities for depressed volatility levels on the index, but causing single stock volatilities to increase materially
- **Correlation discrepancies** between the equity sector to bonds (USD 10Y Swap vs 3M RV SPX Baskets)


## How to choose the right dispersion?
### Two ways to structure the dispersion:
- **Vega Flat** - the index vega notional is set equal to the total vega notional of the stocks
- **Theta Flat** - the index vega notional is overweight and higher than the total vega notional on the stocks
    - e.g. index vol: 20% & stocks weighted vol: 30% >> vega notional: 30/20= 1.5x the notional on the stocks
    
### Two market dynamics    
- **Bullish Market** - Theta Flat outperforms due to the extra short index volatility
- **Bearish Market** - Vega Flat is more resilient thanks to net long volatitily position
