Hi, my name is Kevin - the minion - from films such as Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, Minions, etc.

What you may not know is that I am also a data science lead for (Societe Generale's) SG (Corporate Investment Bank's) CIBâ€™s digital office. Diligently toiling away determining & applying data driven strategy to the bank. Working into the wee hours analyzing and automating conversations in capital markets.

Thank you and Goodnight!
