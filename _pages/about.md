Hi, my name is Kevin - the minion - from films such as Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, and Minions.

What you may not know is that I am also a senior data scientist and member of (Societe Generale's) SG (Corporate Investment Bank's) CIB’s digital office. Diligently toiling away determining & applying data driven strategy to the bank. Working into the wee hours analyzing and automating conversations in capital markets.
